# Configuration file for jagent
#

[MAIN]

; List the services that this instance of jagent will honor.
; Separate selections with commas. Possible choices are jremote,
; jodbc and http.
services=jremote,jodbc,http

; For Linux/Unix/AIX, specify the desired umask for jagent in octal.
;umask = 0002

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

[OPTIONS]

; Set the log level to a value from 0 to 7. Each lower level (except 0)
; includes all of the higher levels. This duplicates the -L (--logLevel)
; command line option.
;  0 = no logging
;  1 = trace - show code execution flow
;  2 = debug - mainly useful for debugging jagent
;  3 = info - show interesting information
;  4 = notice - show notices
;  5 = warning - show warnings
;  6 = errors - show any error conditions
;  7 = critical - show critical errors only
loglevel = 3

; Set the authentication mode for jodbc and jremote connections.
; Available options are none, user or account. This duplicates the
; -A (--authentication) command line option.
;
authentication = none

; If the hostname_lookups option is enabled, a reverse DNS lookup
; is performed on the IP address of incoming connections. If private
; IP addresses are used, there may be no reverse DNS available, and
; the lookup may require up to 5 seconds before it times out. Set
; this option to 'true' only if you need to resolve incoming IP
; addresses into actual host names. This option is not available
; as a command line option.
hostname_lookups = false

; Disables the "nagle algorithm" for TCP connections. Setting this
; option to 'true' disables nagle, and may increase performance.
; This option duplicates the -N command line option.
tcp_nodelay = true

; Specify the port that jagent will listen on for incoming connections.
; The default port is 20002. This option duplicates the -p (--port)
; command line option.
;port = 20002

; If the server has multiple network interfaces, specify the IP address
; where jagent will listen for incoming connections. This duplicates
; the -b (--bind_address) command line option.
;bind_address = <IP address to listen on>

; For SSL connections, specify the path of the x509 certificate to
; use. When a certificate is specified, a private key must also be
; specified. This option duplicates the -c (--certificate) command
; line option.
;certificate = <path to certificate (.pem) file>

; For SSL connections, specify the path of the private key for the
; certificate being used. This option duplicates the -k (--private_key)
; command line option.
;private_key = <path to private key (.pem) file>

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

; The ENVIRONMENT section is used to set up the jBASE
; environment. This section automatically expands environment
; variables found in the value on the right of the equal sign
; when the variable is prefixed by '$' (Linux) or enclosed by
; '%' (Windows).
;
; You can "include" the standard jbase_env.cmd or jbase_env.sh
; script by using the !include directive, followed by the path
; of the script. !include processing is primitive, and any lines
; in the form of VAR=value, set VAR=value or export VAR=value
; are treated as environment variables.
;
; Before this section is processed, two special environment
; variables available: APPDIR, referencing the directory where
; the jagent executable exists (normally, the jBASE bin directory),
; and CURDIR, which refers to the current directory when jagent
; was started. 

[ENVIRONMENT]

; Use the standard jbase_env script to set up the jBASE
; system environment variables.
!include C:\JBASE\CURRENTVERSION\jbase_env.cmd

; Set up the "account" environment variables.
HOME=%CURDIR%
PATH=%HOME%\bin;C:\JBASE\PMIPORTAL\BIN;%PATH%
JBCOBJECTLIST=%HOME%\lib;C:\JBASE\PMIPORTAL\LIB
JEDIFILEPATH=%HOME%;C:\JBASE\PMIPORTAL
JEDIFILENAME_MD=%HOME%\MD

; Disable debugger for common errors
JBASE_ERRMSG_ZERO_USED=2
JBASE_ERRMSG_NON_NUMERIC=2
JBASE_ERRMSG_DIVIDE_ZERO=2
JBASE_ERRMSG_TRACE=0
JBCEMULATE=jbase

; Log runtime errors to $JBCRELEASEDIR/tmp/jbase_error_trace (see documentation before enabling this)
;JBASE_ERRMSG_TRACE=1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

; The HTTP section defines global options when jagent is used as
; an HTTP (REST) server.

[HTTP]

; Specify the value of the Cache-Control header when sending
; static content like html or image files.
cache_control = public

; By default, when a JBC subroutine is used as the resource for
; an HPPT request, the query string included on the URL (or in the
; body when an HTML form is POSTed) is parsed and the query string
; or form variables are passed in the request_vars and request_vals
; arguments. If this is not desired, set no_parse_qstring to 'true'. 
no_parse_qstring=false

maxrequest = 100000000

; Specify the default path to use if the URL path is '/'.
;default_path = <your default path>

; Specify the default file name to use if the resource
; path ends in '/'.
;default_file = <your default file; eg. index.html>

; Specify the HTTP headers to pass to a JBC subroutine. The header names
; are converted to upper-case, prefixed with "HTTP_" and any dashes (-)
; are converted to underscores (_). For example, "User-Agent" is passed
; as "HTTP_USER_AGENT".
http_headers = Accept,Cookie,Connection,User-Agent,Referer,Orgin,Host,Authorization, AUTHORIZATION,X-AUTHORIZATION,X-Authorization,X-Token

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

; The HTTP_RESOURCE section maps a URL path to a server resource.
; The longest part of the URL path is matched against items in this
; section. Specify the URL path on left of the equal sign, and the
; local resource path or JBC subroutine name on the right. Except
; for the root path, the URL path never ends with a '/'.
;
; JBC subroutine resource:
; The resource name is the name of the subroutine with @ prefix,
; for example: /myapi=@MYSUB.
;
; Local directory:
; If the local directory path ends with a trailing directory separator
; ('/' or '\'), the tail of the URL path will be appended to the local
; directory path to form the final resource file name. If the URL
; ends with '/', and a default_file is specified in the [HTTP]
; section, the default file name will be appended to the directory
; path to form the full path for the resource.
;
; Local file:
; Use the local path for the file to be used as the resource. If the
; URL path has a tail after the matched path, the tail is ignored.

[HTTP_RESOURCE]

;<URL path> = <@subname>
;<URL path> = <local directory>
;<URL path> = <local file>
;
; examples:
;/dbc  = @MY.HTTP.SUB
;/img  = C:\www\images\
;
; Use JAGENTWDBINIT subroutine for REST services
/api  = @JAGENTWDBINIT
/apps = C:\Users\patrickp\OneDrive - Zumasys\Apps
/iis = c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

; The HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE section is used to properly process
; binary or text content received in the body of an HTTP
; request. The content type on the left of the equal sign
; is matched with the first segment of the HTTP Content-Type
; header. Content type includes a sub-type using a slash
; to separate the main and sub-types. To match any sub-type,
; specify a '*' as the sub-type. For example,  text/* = text
; will treat any 'text' content type as text no matter what
; the sub-type might be.
;
; If a content type is defined as text, CR/LF in the request_body
; argument passed to the JBC subroutine will converted to @AM.
; Otherwise the request_body argument will be treated as binary
; data. Any content type not defined will be treated as binary.

[HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE]

text/*           = text
application/json = text
application/xml  = text

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

;
; The HTTP_MIME_TYPE section associates file extensions for
; static content with a "mime type", which is sent in the
; HTTP response Content-Type header.
